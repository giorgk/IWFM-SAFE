C   This data file contains the file names and other relevant data that are 
C   used for the simulation of pumping.

C*******************************************************************************
C
C  WELLFL     ; Well pumping specifications data file (max. 1000 characters)
C                  * Leave blank if no wells are simulated
C  ELEMPUMPFL ; Element pumping specifications data file (max. 1000 characters)
C                  * Leave blank if element pumping is not simulated
C  PUMPFL     ; Time series pumping data file (max. 1000 characters)
C                  * Leave blank if pumping rates are not read from a file (for
C                     instance, in a situation where pumping rates are computed 
C                     by an external program)
C  PUMPOUTFL  ; Output file for agricultural and urban element and well pumping
C                  that lists pumping used by the model; this file can only be
